%TOC%
---++ Introduction

Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. Automatic graph drawing has many important applications in software engineering, database and web design, networking, and in visual interfaces for many other domains.

This plugin uses [[http://www.graphviz.org/][Graphviz's]] applications to create an image of a directed graph. The directed graph is described using a simple text markup called "The _dot_ Language". This markup is written between =&lt;dot&gt;= and =&lt;/dot&gt;= tags. By default, a png image attachment is created and displayed inline, replacing the =&lt;dot&gt;= markup. Any other requested formats are saved as attachments.

Visit the [[http://www.graphviz.org/Gallery.php][Graphviz gallery]] to see some examples on what can be achieved with this plugin and Graphviz. Full documentation is available at http://graphviz.org/Documentation.php.

| %X% *Caution* =&lt;dot&gt;= syntax is not compatible with versions of Foswiki:Extensions.WysiwygPlugin prior to 28 June 2009. It is recommended that you upgrade !WysiwygPlugin if you are running an older version. If that is not practical then raw editing is recommended, or use &lt;sticky&gt; tags to protect the dot tags. |
---+++ Attachment Handling
| %X% *By default, this version of the plugin uses the Foswiki API to manipulate the attached graphs. The first user to view a topic containing a directed graph will be denied access if they do not have update permission. If defaults or =dot= parameters have changed, viewing the topic may modify attachments, which will require update permission.* |

The files generated by the =&lt;dot&gt;= command are cached as attachments to the topic. Any change to the =&lt;dot&gt;= input will result in the attachments being updated.

By default, each generated file is attached to the topic using the Foswiki attachment API. This results in revision control of the attached files, and updates to the topic for each generated file. If Foswiki is configured to increment a new revision for each update (See <a target="_top" href="http://foswiki.org/System/ForceNewRevision">http://foswiki.org/System/ForceNewRevision</a> and config parameter =$Foswiki::cfg{ReplaceIfEditedAgainWithin} = 0= ), then every updated attachment will result in a new topic revision due to the changed metadata.

The alternative to this behavior is to use the expert parameter attachPath - set in bin/configure - to configure the plugin to do direct file I/O and bypass the attach API. Direct file I/O results in a considerable performance improvement. Initial rendering of this topic on a test system resulted in a reduction of time to generate the attachments and initially display from 60 seconds down to approximately 8 seconds.

| %X% *Caution* The plugin will also update attached files during __Preview__. If the edit is subsequently cancelled, the attachments will be regenerated again. |

A MD5 hash is calculated for each =dot= command input and the hash is saved in the Foswiki work_area directory. The hash file is named with the Web name, the Topic name, and the suffix ==-filehash== If the calculated hash matches on subsequent page visits, the attached graphics files are used without rerunning Graphviz. If the hash doesn't match, the attachments are regenerated.

Default behavior is to leave any previously generated attachments even if the =&lt;dot&gt;= tags are removed from the file. If the configuration setting DELETEATTACHMENTS is enabled, then the plugin will remove any old attachments that are not needed. However if the final =&lt;dot&gt;= tag is removed, the plugin is not invoked, and the attachments will not be deleted.

| %X% *Caution!* If a topic has not previously been processed by this version of the plugin, attachments named using the original "Graph[32 character hex checksum].jpg will *all* be deleted from the topic when this parameter is enabled! Once the new ==-filehash== file has been created, old style attachments will not be deleted. If you want to go back and clean up the old atachment filenames, you can remove the =Web_Topic-filehash= file from the workare directory. |

If a topic is renamed, the ==-filehash== file in the workarea directory will be renamed as well and regeneration of attachment files will be avoided.

Also note that after changes that modify the order of generated image names, it may be necessary to refresh the browser cache with shift-reload.
---+++ Inline Graphics

The plugin will embed the generated image inline into the resulting HTML page. The inline format defaults to =PNG=. =JPG= and =SVG= formats are also supported.
   * A client side image map can be generated and used for active links within =JPG= and =PNG= images. =SVG= graphics support links natively and do not require Image Maps, however a map can be generated for fallback images used by older browsers.
   * =JPG= and =PNG= images can be created using antialiased text. See more details below. Antialiased text is not applicable to =SVG= graphics.
   * =SVG= images are inserted inline using the &lt;object&gt; tag. 
      * Antialias is disabled when =SVG= images are requested
      * A =PNG= image will be automatically generated and inserted as a fallback image to support older browsers without =SVG= support.
      * Links within the =SVG= file will be altered to include a =target="_top"= parameter to get consistent link behaviour across browsers.
---+++ The !GraphViz Engine

<nop>DirectedGraphPlugin supports the following engines:

   * =dot= - makes "hierarchical" or layered drawings of directed graphs. The layout algorithm aims edges in the same direction (top to bottom, or left to right) and then attempts to avoid edge crossings and reduce edge length. This is the default engine.
   * =neato= and =fdp= - make "spring model" layouts. neato uses the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, which is equivalent to statistical multi-dimensional scaling. fdp implements the Fruchterman-Reingold heuristic including a multigrid solver that handles larger graphs and clustered undirected graphs.
   * =twopi= - radial layout, after Graham Wills 97.
   * =circo= - circular layout, after Six and Tollis 99, Kauffman and Wiese 02. Suitable for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.
The markup is always entered between &lt;dot&gt; tags regardless of the chosen engine.
---++ Syntax Rules

Enclose the description for your directed graph within =&lt;dot&gt; ... &lt;/dot&gt;= tags.

You can use the following parameters in the =dot= tag to control the rendering of your graph (All parameters are optional):

| *Parameter:* | *Description:* | *Default:* |
| =map="on"= | Create a client side map for the generated image. This will turn any =[URL="..."];= attribute in the graph description into a clickable area (see demonstration below). | =off= |
| =vectorformats="ps svg"= | The PNG file created from the graph per default is a bitmap file. If you need a vector based file rendering or other bitmap types, add them to this list, separated by a space. (If the Foswiki attach API is used, they will be attached to topic, visible under attachments view). Any format supported by !GraphViz is supported by this plugin and is mapped to the =-T= parameter.  Examples include jpg, ps, gif, etc.  The type =dot= will attach the parsed input to the topic. | none |
| =engine="neato"= | Which layout engine to use for the graph: One of =dot=, =neato=, =twopi=, =circo= or =fdp=. | =dot= |
| =library="Main.GroupIcons"= | Which icon library topic to use for custom shapes ([shapefile] parameter). Needs to be explicitly set, also if icons are attached locally to the current graph topic. See demo below. | (this topic) |
| =file="file_prefix"= | Overrides the dynamically generated filenames. If specified, must be unique for each graph within a single topic! Suffix is still generated automatically based upon file type.  | =graph_nn= nn increments per graph |
| =hideattachments="on"= | Set whether or not attachments should be hidden from the attachment table | =on= |
| =inline="png"<br />inlineattach="png"= | Specifies the type of file to be attached inline to the page. Must be png or jpg or svg. | =png= |
| =linkattachments="off"= | Add links for file types other than the inline type if present | =off= |
| =dothash="on"= | Controls the hash calculation against the =dot= command input. If the =dot= hash is disabled, a previously created .png file will not be recreated unless the attachment is deleted, or the =dothash= parameter is enabled or removed. This can be used to create a portable topic and attachments that can be moved without regenerating all of the graphs. Used in the HowtoDirectedGraphs topic. | =on= |
| =forceattachapi="off"= | Force standard Foswiki attachment API processing. Ignores setting of configure attachPath and attachUrlPath parameters. Used if revision control is desired for the attachments. | =off= |
| *Postscript based Antialiasing (optional)* |||
| =antialias="on"= | Enable antialiasing of current graph by setting this to =on=. Note that if Graphviz is installed with the cairo rendering engine, this option should not be needed. When enabled, a postscript image is created, and post-processed with the !ImageMagick "convert" utility. | =off= |
| =density="300"= | Passed to the imagemagick =convert= utility. Specifies the dots per inch used for image generation. This should be significantly higher than the =dpi= used by !GraphViz | =300= |
| =size="2000x1600"= | Passed to the imagemagick =convert= as the ="-geometry"= parameter and controls size of rendered image (use =size= parameter in graph description for controlling the size of the image with antialiasing =off=). If set to =size="auto"=, the size will be taken from a .png file generated by !GraphViz. | =auto= |

---++++ Description of the settings
Changes to the settings marked %X% will cause changes to the file hash. This will result in the attached graphcs being regenerated on the next view

*All settings are prefixed with =DIRECTEDGRAPHPLUGIN_= as shown above*  _The prefix is ommited from this table to improve layout_

| *Setting* | *Description* | *dot override* | *Default* |
| ENGINE | %X% Layout engine to use per default. Can be one of =dot=, =neato=, =twopi=, =circo= or =fdp= | engine="dot" | =dot= |
| ANTIALIAS | %X% Antialias option. If set to =on= the plugin will use the =convert= binary from the imagemagick package to pretty print graphs. This option should not be used with clientside maps as pixel dimensions are usually altered in this process and therefore the "hot spot" locations will not match the generated image. With antialiasing off, rendering size is controlled by =dot= (can be effected by an eventual size parameter in the digraph description), with antialiasing on you set the final image size in pixels explicitly with the size parameter. (If you must use an image map with this option, take care manually that the two generated pixel sizes match). | antialias="off" | =off= |
| DENSITY | %X% Default density (dpi) for antialias option. 300 dpi should be sufficient for most purposes (if your graphs look blurred at large image sizes try using a higher value). | density="300" | =300= |
| HIDEATTACHMENTS | %X% Set whether or not attached files should be automatically hidden in the attachments table. (n/a for direct file I/O) | hideattachments="on" | =on= |
| INLINEATTACHMENT | %X% Set the format for inline attachment files. png, jpg or svg | inline="png" | =png= |
| SVGFALLBACK | Set a fallback image type for older browsers when SVG inline is set. Set to =png= or =jpg= | svgfallback="png" | =png= |
| SVGLINKTARGET | Modify the generated SVG with a =target="_top"= attribute. This makes link behaviour compatible between IE and Firefox | svglinktarget="on" | =on= |
| LINKATTACHMENTS | Include links for other attachment types if specified. Generates links in the format of =[ps]=, =[pdf]= following the inline image. | linkattachments="on" | =on= |
| DELETEATTACHMENTS | If enabled, the plugin will delete any remaining attachments when a =&lt;dot&gt;= is removed or modified. | [n/a] | =off= |
| LEGACYCLEANUP | If enabled, the plugin will attempt to convert older TWiki style attachments and hash entries into the new Foswiki format. Only enable if migrating topics and the working directory from a TWiki installation. | [n/a] | =off= |
| FORCEATTACHAPI | If enabled, the plugin will ignore the "configure" settings of =attachPath= and =attachUrlPath=. Forcing use of the attachment API can be used to create topics that are portable across Foswiki installations. (for example, the HowtoDirectedGraphs topic) It can be also used to get standard attachment revision history handling on the generated attachments. [This parameter is ignored and the Foswiki attachment API always used if the configure settings =attachPath= and =attachUrlPath= are not supplied. | forceattachapi="off" | =off= |
| SIZE | %X% Default image size (pixels, =widthxheight=) for antialias option (keeps aspect ratio; enlarges until max of one of the dimensions is reached). | size="800x600" | =800x600= |
| VECTORFORMATS | %X% Additional output formats to create per default. Displayed version defaults to PNG, others are attached. Options are =ps= and =svg= (space separated). Any output format supported by !GraphViz can be specified. The =ps= format is useful to have handy if you are later converting your document to <nop>LaTeX or other typesetting / publication utility. The =svg= format has inline clickable map if used. | vectorformats="png,jpg" | =none= |
| LIBRARY | %X% Default topic to read library icons (shapefiles) from | library="Web.Topic" | (this topic) |
| DEBUG | Debug plugin: (See output in =data/debug.txt=) | [n/a] | =0= |

---+++ Foswiki bin/configure settings
All settings start with =$Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{DirectedGraphPlugin}=, and on many systems, these are optional.
---++++ Standard Settings
| ={{Enabled}= | Set to 1 to enable the plugin |
| ={enginePath}= | Path to the !GraphViz executable. On many systems this is not required if the !GraphViz executables are on the default path |
| ={magickPath}= | Path to the !ImageMagick convert utility. Again optional if the imagemagick utilities ( =convert= ) can be found on the default path |
| ={toolsPath}= | Path to the Foswiki tools directory. The DirectedGraphPlugin.pl helper script is found in this directory. Typically found in the web server root along with bin, data, pub, etc. If not provided the plugin will guess based upon the current working directory |
| ={perlCmd}= | Perl command used on this system. On many systems this can just be the "perl" command, and the default will be acceptable if =perl= is found on the default path. |
---++++ Expert settings
| ={Module}= | Required. Set to ='Foswiki::Plugins::DirectedGraphPlugin'= Do not change |
| ={generateRevAttachments}= | Flag specifying if the plugin should generate graphs when viewing previous topic revisions. If the plugin generates attachments when viewing old revisions, this can result in out of date attachments, and significant overhead regenerating the attachments. Enable this flag to restore previous behavior of the plugin Note that by default, old revisions of attachments can be viewed using the attach dialog. |
| ={generateDiffAttachments}= | Flag specifying if the plugin should generate graphs when comparing two topic revisions. If the plugin generates attachments during compare operations, this can result in out of date attachments, and significant overhead regenerating the attachments. Enable this setting to restore the prior behavior of the plugin. |
| ={attachPath}= | Path for plugin to store generated attachments. (Optional). If not provided, plugin will manage attachments using the standard Foswiki attachment functions. If not provided, first visit to System.DirectedGraphPlugin will require admin / sudo login so that the plugin can save the example attachments. If set to the full path to the pub directory, generated attachments will be stored along with regular attachments but will be invisible to Foswiki topics. This directory must be web readable. If not set to the "General Path Settings" {PubDir} path web server changes will be required to enable access. |
| ={attachUrlPath}= | URL Path for generated attachments (Optional). Only required if attachPath is provided, and is not the same as the "General Path settings" {PubDir} path. If not provided, plugin will use the value of "General Path Settings" {PubUrlPath} for linking to attachments. If the attachPath is not provided, then this parameter will be ignored. |

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions

---+++ Before you upgrade!
   * This version of the plugin changes the default for the =size= parameter to =size="auto"=.  Image size for antialiasing will be detected from the !GraphViz  output.
   * This version also now uses the !ImageMagick =identify= utility to extract the image size
   * Significant changes in the previous release:
      * The plugin will not longer generate graphs when it detects that a topic revision is being viewed, or a topic comparison is being performed. See the expert configuration parameters to restore the prior behavior.
      * Support for inline SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics - has been added.

---+++ Installation
   1 <em>follow instructions for your distribution. </em>Install !GraphViz, Imagemagick, ghostscript. If available, install the msttcorefonts. Also install perl modules Digest::MD5, Storable, File::Copy, File::Path, File::Spec, and File::Temp using CPAN whatever is appropriate for your distribution.
   1 Use the "Extensions" tab in bin/configure Click the "Find More Extensions" button, locate the DirectedGraphPlugin and click the "Install" button. 
      * Alternative - manually install the plugin from the shell: 
         a. Retrieve installer and the .tgz or .zip file, attached to [[http://foswiki.org/Extensions/DirectedGraphPlugin][Foswiki.org]]
         a. Put the installer and archive into your foswiki root directory
         a. Run the installer and follow the prompts perl !DirectedGraphPlugin_installer.pl
   1 Using the Foswiki configure interface, set the paths to the graphviz dot and !ImageMagick convert commands, along with perl, and the Foswiki tools directory. __(If perl and the default tools are found on the default system path, configuration is not required)__
   1 Enable the plugin in the configuration settings.
   1 Optionally set the attachPath and attachUrlPath Expert settings. (Click the button to expose expert settings) These can be set to match the Foswiki pubUrlPath and pubDir settings, or set to a web-readable directory outside of Foswiki. This improves performance but loses revision tracking of generated files.
---+++ Debian users
   1 Install the prerequisites and plugin using apt-get 
      * apt-get install graphviz
      * apt-get install imagemagick
      * apt-get install msttcorefonts
      * apt-get install ghostscript-gpl
      * apt-get install foswiki-directedgraphplugin
   1 Proceed with step 3 above
---+++ Reminders:
   * If not set, the standard Foswiki "attach" API will be used by the plugin. View users will require "update" permission if the plugin needs to regenerate the attached files.
   * If the attachPath is set, standard Foswiki attachment handling will be bypassed and files will be written directly to this path. Attachments will not be subject to revision controls.
   * If the attachPath is _not_ the Foswiki pub directory, then the attachUrlPath must be configured for the plugin to generate correct URLs. The web server must be configured to permit access to this directory.
   * %X% The plugin does not attempt to manage attachments across changes between direct file I/O and the Foswiki API. Attachments can be orphaned when these parameters are changed.
---+++ Verify your installation
   * Ensure that the =dot= command can manually generate a png file. From a command prompt, enter =dot -v= Then ^c and examine the output. You should see =png= as a listed device, and can confirm that textlayout uses =cairo=.
   * If using the antialias option, ensure that ImageMagic =convert= command can convert from a .ps to .png format.
---+++ Errors returned by the plugin:
| *Error* | *Description* |
| ==DirectedGraph Error (1):== on all examples. | Verify the value of =perlCmd= in lib/LocalSite.cfg |
| ==DirectedGraph Error (2):== on all examples | Verify the value of =toolsPath= in lib/LocalSite.cfg |
| ==DirectedGraph Error (9): <br /> The system cannot find the path specified.== on all examples | Verify the value of =enginePath= in lib/LocalSite.cfg |
| ==DirectedGraph Error (25):== | Verify the =enginePath= in lib/LocalSite.cfg - dot utility was not found|
| ==DirectedGraph Error (9): <br /> !DirectedGraphPlugin error:Format: "png" not recognized.== Format might be any of =png=, =ps=, or =cmapx= | !GraphViz was not configured or built correctly. Try running ==dot -c -vV== to reconfigure and show the file formats supported by the installation |
| ==DirectedGraph Error (1):== on the antialias examples | Verify the =magickPath= in lib/LocalSite.cfg |
| ==DirectedGraph Error (20):== on the antialias examples | Verify the =magickPath= in lib/LocalSite.cfg - convert utility was not found|
| ==DirectedGraph Error (1):== on the antialias examples | Verify that !GhostScript is installed correctly. From a command prompt attempt to convert a .ps file to .gif format. If !ImageMagick reports =="Postscript delegate failed:"== error, then the problem is probably with !GhostScript |

---+++ Notes on antialiasing

There are three ways to accomplish antialiased output. 
   * Postscript based antialiasing,  enabled by the ==antialias="on"== parameter
   * Native antialiasing performed by !GraphViz when the cairo rendering engine is installed.
   * _Scalable Vector Graphics_ (.svg) output are antialiased by the browser, so no special processing is required._

The plugin performs no special processing for the last two cases.

If ==antialias="on"== is specified, the following method used:
   1 !GraphViz generates the graph output in both postscript format (.ps) and in the inline format (.jpg or .png)
      * _GraphViz_ uses the graph =size= parameter to set the image size in inches, and =dpi= to set expected displayed dots per inch (default 96)
         * %T% Don't confuse the graph parameters with the plugin parameters
         * Example: =digraph G { size="2,3!"; dpi="96";=
   1 The plugin uses it's =size= and =density= parameters to control the conversion from postscript to the inline format
      * Example:  =&lt;dot size="500x300" density="300"&gt;=
      * If =size="auto"= is set, the !ImageMagick utility =identify= is used to extract the geometry of the inline format image.
   1 Finally, the !ImageMagick =convert= utility converts the postscript (.ps) file to the inline format.  The =density= parameter is set higher than the =dpi= used by !GraphViz.  This causes the image to be internally rendered at a larger size, that is then reduced back to the original dimensions set by the =size= parameter.   When the image is reduced, the fonts are antialiased. 
      * (<nop>ImageMagick =convert= uses <nop>GhostScript internally to from postscript)

Antialiasing is not applicable with inline =svg= graphics, but will be applied to the fallback image generated for older browsers.

As documented on the [[http://www.graphviz.org/doc/FAQ.html#Q8][graphviz FAQ]] on the "Linux bleeding edge", install the cairo graphics backend library, along with the graphviz-cairo plugin. (It appears that the current graphviz includes cairo support without the plugin.)

You can determine what rendering engine is used for any specified file type by running the =dot= command from the command shell. *If the rendering is done with cairo, you already have antialiased output and should not need to use the =antialias="on"= parameter.*
